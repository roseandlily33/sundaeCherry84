# Professional README Generator 
Week #9 Project to create a professional readme geenrator that takes in input on a command line and creates a readme about your project. Made with node.js, node.js fs, and inquirer. 

## Description:
This weeks challenge is to build a readme generator that takes in input and creates a readme based on the answers given. For the list of licenses I found a list on google that was the 6 most popular licenses, and for the information about the license I found that on tldrlegal, see the bottom of the readme for links.

## Screenshots:
Coming Soon

## Problem It Solves:
It saves time by easily being able to enter information about your project without having to remeber what to add to it. 

## What I Learned:
I learned how to use inquirer, which turned out to be quite an easy things to use. 
I also learned how to create a markdown with template literals. 
As well as what the actual licenses there are and how you can use them which is great information to know and is a great thing to require in this project. 

## Difficulties:
My greatest difficulty was figuring out how to apply the badge, then it hit me that it's just intersting a picture like you would do normally, and I love using switch statements, so I used a switch statement with the badge links that I found (See under resources). 

## Sucesses:
Using inquirer, used the module.export and importing, and using the fs built in node.js library. Overall it was quite an project that I really enjoyed. 

## How To Use:
- Clone the git repository
- Type npm install in terminal to install the necessary packages
- Run node index.js and begin answering the questions

## Resources That I Used:
